# Practical MachineLearning Project

Repository for the Coursera Practical Machine Learning course project

This project looks at predicting manner in which a number of participants performed an exercise using the 'classe' variable.

The data is from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.

The data was partitioned into training and test data sets and trained against various models with the random forest model producing the best preduction with an out of sample error rate of less than 1%.
